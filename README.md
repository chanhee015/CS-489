# CS-489
## How to run this code?
1. Run generate_empty_files.py to generate empty files first.
2. Run main.py - while it is running, you are able to use cs489 bot on Telegram.
- But since we are already running it on server - you can just try it on Telegram!
- Running with same token (given PW for each bots) will make our bot stop.
